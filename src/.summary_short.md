# Directory: src/

Purpose: Contains the main source code for the genai-lite library, providing the public API and core type definitions.

## Files:

- `index.ts`: Exports the public API of the genai-lite library, providing access to the LLM service with createMessages method (and its result type), model preset types, configuration options, thinking extraction settings, API key management functionality, llama.cpp integration (adapter, server client, and types), OpenRouter integration (adapter and config), utility functions (createFallbackModelInfo), and template metadata parsing utilities.
- `types.ts`: Defines the core type interface for API key retrieval functionality across different AI providers.

## Subdirectories:

- `config/`: Contains default presets configuration JSON files (llm-presets.json, image-presets.json).
- `types/`: Contains type definitions including the ModelPreset interface and image generation types.
- `llm/`: Core LLM service implementation with support for configurable presets.
- `image/`: Image generation service implementation with support for cloud and local providers.
- `adapters/`: Provider adapters for image generation (OpenAI Images, genai-electron diffusion).
- `shared/`: Shared utilities including PresetManager, AdapterRegistry, and error handling utilities.
- `logging/`: Configurable logging system with default console logger.
- `providers/`: Built-in API key provider implementations.
- `prompting/`: Sophisticated utilities for prompt engineering including template rendering, content preparation, and response parsing.
