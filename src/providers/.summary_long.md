# Directory: src/providers/

## Overview
The providers directory contains implementations of the `ApiKeyProvider` interface, which is a fundamental abstraction in the genai-lite library for managing API authentication. Currently, it houses the built-in environment variable provider, which offers a secure, convention-based approach to API key management. This directory demonstrates the library's extensibility pattern, where users can either use the provided implementation or create custom providers for their specific authentication needs.

## Key Components
### fromEnvironment.ts
## Overview
This module exports a flexible API key provider implementation that retrieves API keys from system environment variables. It follows the industry-standard convention of storing sensitive keys in environment variables with a predictable naming pattern, while also supporting provider aliases and special handling for local providers that don't require authentication.

## Key Components
- **PROVIDER_ENV_VAR_ALIASES**: A mapping of provider-specific environment variable aliases
  - Example: `openai-images` accepts both `OPENAI_IMAGES_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **fromEnvironment**: An `ApiKeyProvider` implementation that:
  - Takes a provider ID as input (e.g., "openai", "anthropic")
  - Returns 'not-needed' for local providers (llamacpp, mock, genai-electron-images)
  - Converts the provider ID to uppercase and replaces hyphens with underscores
  - Looks for environment variable in format `{PROVIDER}_API_KEY`
  - Falls back to checking provider aliases if standard env var not found
  - Returns the API key value or null if not found

## Architecture & Design
- Implements the `ApiKeyProvider` interface as an async function
- Uses a convention-based approach for environment variable naming
- Follows security best practices by keeping API keys out of code
- Special handling for local/test providers that don't require API keys
- Alias support for providers that share API keys (e.g., openai-images uses OpenAI key)

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: `ApiKeyProvider` type from "../types"
- **External**: Node.js `process.env` global

## Integration Points
This provider is designed to be used with the LLMService as a standard way to supply API keys. It integrates with the broader genai-lite library's flexible API key management system, allowing users to easily configure authentication through environment variables.

## Usage Examples
```typescript
// Setting environment variable
// export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

// Using with LLMService
import { LLMService, fromEnvironment } from 'genai-lite';

const service = new LLMService(fromEnvironment);
// Will look for OPENAI_API_KEY when using OpenAI
```

- `src/llm/LLMService.ts` - Main service that uses API key providers
- `src/index.ts` - Exports this provider as part of the public API

### fromEnvironment.test.ts
## Overview
This test file validates the `fromEnvironment` function, which provides a simple environment variable-based implementation of the `ApiKeyProvider` interface. The tests ensure the function correctly retrieves API keys from environment variables using a standardized naming convention (`{PROVIDER}_API_KEY`), handles various edge cases, and returns null when keys are not found.

## Test Coverage
- **Environment variable retrieval**: Verifies successful key retrieval from process.env
- **Case handling**: Tests uppercase conversion of provider IDs and mixed-case inputs
- **Edge cases**: Empty provider IDs, non-existent keys, and empty environment variable values
- **Special characters**: Validates handling of hyphens and underscores in provider names

## Testing Approach
- Uses Jest's environment isolation by saving and restoring `process.env` between tests
- Each test creates a clean environment state to prevent test pollution
- Tests are focused on single behaviors with descriptive names
- Uses async/await pattern even though the function is synchronous (prepared for future async implementations)

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: `./fromEnvironment` - The implementation being tested
- **External**: Jest testing framework

## Key Test Scenarios
- Standard retrieval: `OPENAI_API_KEY` from provider ID 'openai'
- Case insensitivity: 'anthropic', 'GeMiNi' all map correctly
- Null returns: Non-existent keys, empty provider IDs, and empty environment values
- Special character handling: Provider IDs with hyphens/numbers like 'provider-123'

## Usage Examples
```typescript
// Example test pattern for new providers
it('should retrieve custom provider key', async () => {
  process.env.CUSTOM_API_KEY = 'test-custom-key';
  const key = await fromEnvironment('custom');
  expect(key).toBe('test-custom-key');
});

// Testing with the actual implementation
import { fromEnvironment } from './fromEnvironment';
const apiKey = await fromEnvironment('openai'); // Looks for OPENAI_API_KEY
```

- `../types.ts` - ApiKeyProvider type definition
- `../llm/LLMService.test.ts` - Tests using fromEnvironment in context

## Architecture
The providers directory demonstrates a clean implementation of the Strategy pattern for API key management:
1. **Interface Definition**: The `ApiKeyProvider` type from `src/types.ts` defines the contract
2. **Built-in Implementation**: `fromEnvironment` provides a ready-to-use environment variable strategy
3. **Extensibility**: Users can create custom providers following the same interface

This design allows for:
- Flexibility in how API keys are stored and retrieved
- Security by keeping keys out of source code
- Easy testing with mock providers
- Support for various deployment scenarios (cloud, on-premise, etc.)

## Internal Dependencies
- Depends on the `ApiKeyProvider` type from the parent types module
- No other internal dependencies, maintaining loose coupling

## External Dependencies
- Uses Node.js built-in `process.env` for environment variable access
- Jest for testing infrastructure

## Integration Points
The providers directory serves as a key integration point for authentication:
- **Primary Consumer**: `LLMService` constructor accepts any `ApiKeyProvider` implementation
- **Public API**: `fromEnvironment` is exported through `src/index.ts` for library consumers
- **Extension Point**: Users can implement custom providers for their authentication needs

## Usage Examples
```typescript
// Using the built-in provider
import { LLMService, fromEnvironment } from 'genai-lite';
const service = new LLMService(fromEnvironment);

// Creating a custom provider for database storage
const customProvider: ApiKeyProvider = async (providerId) => {
  const keyDoc = await db.collection('api_keys').findOne({ provider: providerId });
  return keyDoc?.key || null;
};
const customService = new LLMService(customProvider);

// Creating a provider with fallback
const fallbackProvider: ApiKeyProvider = async (providerId) => {
  // Try environment first
  const envKey = await fromEnvironment(providerId);
  if (envKey) return envKey;
  
  // Fall back to config file
  const config = await loadConfig();
  return config.apiKeys[providerId] || null;
};
```
