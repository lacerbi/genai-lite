# Directory: src/providers/

Purpose: Contains implementations of API key providers for secure authentication key management.

## Files:

- `fromEnvironment.ts`: Provides an API key provider that retrieves authentication keys from environment variables following a standardized naming convention (`{PROVIDER}_API_KEY`), with special handling for local providers (llamacpp, mock, genai-electron-images) that return 'not-needed', and support for provider aliases (e.g., openai-images accepts OPENAI_API_KEY).
- `fromEnvironment.test.ts`: Tests the `fromEnvironment` function which retrieves API keys from environment variables based on provider IDs.
