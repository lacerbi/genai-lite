Purpose: Contains the core LLM service implementation, type definitions, and configuration system for managing multiple AI providers.

## Files:

- `LLMService.ts`: Orchestrates large language model (LLM) requests across multiple AI providers through a unified interface that manages API keys, validates inputs, applies settings, routes requests to provider-specific adapters, and provides configurable model presets.
- `LLMService.test.ts`: Tests the LLMService class to ensure proper initialization, request validation, API key handling, adapter routing, settings management, and provider/model information retrieval.
- `LLMService.presets.test.ts`: Tests the configurable model presets system including default presets, extend mode, replace mode, and edge cases for preset management.
- `config.ts`: Defines the configuration registry for all supported LLM providers and models, including their capabilities, pricing, defaults, and adapter mappings.
- `config.test.ts`: Tests the LLM configuration module's functionality including provider validation, model retrieval, settings management, and validation of LLM parameters.
- `types.ts`: Defines comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types for LLM (Large Language Model) interactions including messages, requests, responses, provider configurations, reasoning settings, and error handling structures.
