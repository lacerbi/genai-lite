# Directory: src/llm/

Purpose: Contains the core LLM service implementation, type definitions, configuration system, and refactored services for managing multiple AI providers.

## Files:

- `LLMService.ts`: Orchestrates LLM requests across multiple AI providers by delegating to specialized services (PresetManager, AdapterRegistry, RequestValidator, SettingsManager, ModelResolver) while maintaining the unified public API, including createMessages that now returns settings from template metadata.
- `LLMService.test.ts`: Tests the LLMService class to ensure proper initialization, request validation, API key handling, adapter routing, settings management, and provider/model information retrieval.
- `LLMService.presets.test.ts`: Tests the configurable model presets system including default presets, extend mode, replace mode, and edge cases for preset management.
- `LLMService.createMessages.test.ts`: Tests the unified prompt creation functionality that combines template rendering, model context injection, role tag parsing, and template metadata extraction.
- `LLMService.sendMessage.preset.test.ts`: Tests the preset-based messaging functionality for sending messages using preset configurations.
- `LLMService.original.ts`: Backup of the original monolithic LLMService before refactoring (872 lines).
- `config.ts`: Defines the configuration registry for all supported LLM providers and models (openai, anthropic, gemini, mistral, llamacpp, mock), including their capabilities, pricing, defaults, adapter mappings, and the createFallbackModelInfo helper for flexible model validation.
- `config.test.ts`: Tests the LLM configuration module's functionality including provider validation, model retrieval, settings management, and validation of LLM parameters.
- `types.ts`: Defines comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types for LLM (Large Language Model) interactions including messages, requests, responses (with LLMFailureResponse now including partialResponse field for validation errors), provider configurations (with allowUnknownModels field for flexible model validation), reasoning settings, thinking extraction settings with intelligent onMissing enforcement, and error handling structures.
