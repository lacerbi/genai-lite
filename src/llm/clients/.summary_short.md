# Directory: src/llm/clients/

Purpose: Contains provider-specific LLM client adapters that implement a common interface to integrate with various AI providers' APIs.

## Files:

- `types.ts`: Defines the TypeScript interface contract and types that all LLM provider client adapters must implement to handle provider-specific API interactions in a standardized way.
- `OpenAIClientAdapter.ts`: Implements an adapter that integrates with OpenAI's API to send chat completions requests and normalize responses into a standardized format.
- `OpenAIClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the OpenAI client adapter's functionality including API key validation, message formatting, and error handling.
- `AnthropicClientAdapter.ts`: Implements an adapter that translates between the standardized LLM interface and Anthropic's Claude API, handling message formatting, API calls, and error mapping.
- `AnthropicClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the Anthropic client adapter's message formatting, API interactions, and error handling for Claude models.
- `GeminiClientAdapter.ts`: Implements the Google Gemini API client adapter that translates between the library's unified interface and Gemini's specific API requirements, including thinking/reasoning mode support.
- `GeminiClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the Gemini client adapter's functionality including message conversion, safety settings, and error handling.
- `LlamaCppServerClient.ts`: Utility client for interacting with llama.cpp server's non-LLM endpoints including tokenization, embeddings, health checks, and server management.
- `LlamaCppServerClient.test.ts`: Tests the llama.cpp server client's methods for all server endpoints with 100% coverage (25 tests).
- `LlamaCppClientAdapter.ts`: Implements an adapter for llama.cpp server integration using the OpenAI-compatible API endpoint for chat completions, supporting local LLM inference without API keys.
- `LlamaCppClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the llama.cpp client adapter's functionality including health checks, message formatting, and connection error handling with 98.11% coverage (26 tests).
- `OpenRouterClientAdapter.ts`: Implements an adapter for the OpenRouter API gateway that provides unified access to 100+ LLM models from multiple providers through an OpenAI-compatible interface with provider routing and app attribution support.
- `OpenRouterClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the OpenRouter client adapter's functionality including API key validation, message formatting, provider routing settings, and error handling.
- `MockClientAdapter.ts`: Implements a mock LLM client adapter that simulates AI provider responses without making real API calls for testing and development purposes.
- `MockClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the mock client adapter's simulation capabilities including various response patterns and error scenarios.
