# Directory: src/llm/clients/

Purpose: Contains provider-specific LLM client adapters that implement a common interface to integrate with various AI providers' APIs.

## Files:

- `types.ts`: Defines the TypeScript interface contract and types that all LLM provider client adapters must implement to handle provider-specific API interactions in a standardized way.
- `adapterErrorUtils.ts`: Maps various error types from LLM provider APIs and network layers to standardized error codes and types for consistent error handling across all adapters.
- `adapterErrorUtils.test.ts`: Tests the error mapping utility function that standardizes various error types from different LLM providers into a consistent error format.
- `OpenAIClientAdapter.ts`: Implements an adapter that integrates with OpenAI's API to send chat completions requests and normalize responses into a standardized format.
- `OpenAIClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the OpenAI client adapter's functionality including API key validation, message formatting, and error handling.
- `AnthropicClientAdapter.ts`: Implements an adapter that translates between the standardized LLM interface and Anthropic's Claude API, handling message formatting, API calls, and error mapping.
- `AnthropicClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the Anthropic client adapter's message formatting, API interactions, and error handling for Claude models.
- `GeminiClientAdapter.ts`: Implements the Google Gemini API client adapter that translates between the library's unified interface and Gemini's specific API requirements, including thinking/reasoning mode support.
- `GeminiClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the Gemini client adapter's functionality including message conversion, safety settings, and error handling.
- `MockClientAdapter.ts`: Implements a mock LLM client adapter that simulates AI provider responses without making real API calls for testing and development purposes.
- `MockClientAdapter.test.ts`: Tests the mock client adapter's simulation capabilities including various response patterns and error scenarios.
