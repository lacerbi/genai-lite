# Directory: src/llm/services/

## Overview
The services directory contains the refactored service classes extracted from the original monolithic LLMService.ts (872 lines). Each service implements a specific responsibility following the Single Responsibility Principle, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand. These services work together through the main LLMService orchestrator to provide the complete LLM request processing pipeline.

## Key Components

### PresetManager.ts
## Overview
Manages the loading, merging, and resolution of model presets. Supports two modes: 'extend' (default) which adds custom presets to the defaults, and 'replace' which uses only custom presets. This service enables users to define reusable model configurations with pre-defined settings.

## Key Components
- **PresetManager** (class): Handles all preset-related operations
  - `constructor(customPresets?, mode?)`: Initializes with custom presets and integration mode
  - `getPresets()`: Returns all configured presets
  - `resolvePreset(presetId)`: Finds and returns a specific preset by ID
- **PresetMode** (type): 'extend' | 'replace' - defines preset integration strategy

## Architecture & Design
- Uses a Map internally for efficient preset lookup by ID
- Loads default presets from `config/presets.json`
- Immutable design - returns copies of arrays to prevent external modification
- Simple, focused API with just two public methods

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: `../../types/presets` (ModelPreset type), `../../config/presets.json` (default presets)
- **External**: None

### AdapterRegistry.ts
## Overview
Manages the lifecycle of LLM provider adapters including initialization, registration, and retrieval. Automatically instantiates adapters for all supported providers at startup and provides a fallback MockAdapter for providers without real implementations. This service centralizes adapter management and provides visibility into adapter availability.

## Key Components
- **AdapterRegistry** (class): Central registry for all provider adapters
  - `constructor()`: Initializes and registers all available adapters
  - `registerAdapter(providerId, adapter)`: Registers a new adapter
  - `getAdapter(providerId)`: Retrieves adapter with automatic fallback
  - `getRegisteredAdapters()`: Returns information about all registered adapters
  - `getProviderSummary()`: Provides summary of provider availability
- **AdapterInfo** (interface): Information about a registered adapter
- **ProviderSummary** (interface): Summary statistics about providers

## Architecture & Design
- Eager initialization - all adapters created at startup
- Automatic fallback to MockAdapter for missing implementations
- Uses Map for O(1) adapter lookup
- Comprehensive logging for debugging adapter issues
- Handles adapter initialization failures gracefully

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: Types, client adapters (Mock, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), config
- **External**: None (adapters handle their own dependencies)

### RequestValidator.ts
## Overview
Validates all aspects of LLM requests including message structure, settings, and reasoning capabilities. Provides detailed error messages for validation failures, ensuring only valid requests reach the provider adapters. This service acts as the gatekeeper for request quality.

## Key Components
- **RequestValidator** (class): Comprehensive request validation
  - `validateRequestStructure(request)`: Validates basic request structure and messages
  - `validateSettings(settings, providerId, modelId)`: Validates LLM settings
  - `validateReasoningSettings(modelInfo, reasoning, request)`: Validates reasoning compatibility

## Architecture & Design
- Returns null for valid inputs, LLMFailureResponse for failures
- Detailed error messages include context (provider, model, specific issue)
- Validates message roles against allowed values
- Checks reasoning settings against model capabilities
- Leverages config module's validateLLMSettings for settings validation

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: Types (various), config (validateLLMSettings)
- **External**: None

### SettingsManager.ts
## Overview
Handles the complex task of merging user-provided settings with model and provider defaults, then filtering out unsupported parameters. This service ensures each provider receives only the parameters it supports while maintaining the correct precedence of settings (user > model > provider > global).

## Key Components
- **SettingsManager** (class): Settings merging and filtering
  - `mergeSettingsForModel(modelId, providerId, requestSettings?)`: Three-way merge of settings
  - `filterUnsupportedParameters(settings, modelInfo, providerInfo)`: Removes unsupported params
  - `validateTemplateSettings(settings)`: Validates settings extracted from template metadata

## Architecture & Design
- Three-level settings hierarchy with proper precedence
- Comprehensive logging for debugging settings issues
- Special handling for reasoning settings on non-supporting models
- Proper merging of thinking extraction settings with defaults
- Null-safe merging using nullish coalescing operator
- Defensive copying to prevent mutation
- Validation of template-extracted settings with type checking and warnings

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: Types, config (getDefaultSettingsForModel)
- **External**: None

### ModelResolver.ts
## Overview
Resolves model information from either preset IDs or direct provider/model IDs. This service handles the complexity of preset resolution, provider validation, and model lookup, providing a unified way to determine which model to use for a request. Implements flexible model validation that creates fallback ModelInfo for unknown models instead of returning errors, with provider-level control via the `allowUnknownModels` flag.

## Key Components
- **ModelResolver** (class): Model and preset resolution
  - `constructor(presetManager)`: Requires PresetManager for preset lookups
  - `resolve(options)`: Main resolution method supporting both presets and direct IDs
- **ModelSelectionOptions** (interface): Input options for resolution
- **ModelResolution** (interface): Resolution result with error handling

## Architecture & Design
- Preset-first resolution - presets take precedence over direct IDs
- Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes
- Validates provider support before model lookup
- Merges preset settings with user settings (user takes precedence)
- **Flexible model validation**: When a model ID is not found in configuration:
  - For providers with `allowUnknownModels: true` (e.g., llamacpp, mock): Creates fallback ModelInfo silently
  - For other providers (e.g., openai, anthropic): Logs warning but creates fallback ModelInfo and allows request to proceed
  - Uses `createFallbackModelInfo()` helper from config.ts to generate sensible defaults
- Enables support for arbitrary model names in local providers and testing scenarios

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: Types, PresetManager, config (validation functions, createFallbackModelInfo)
- **External**: None

## Architecture
The services follow a consistent pattern:
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles exactly one concern
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: Services return null for success or LLMFailureResponse for errors
3. **Immutable Operations**: Services don't modify input data
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: All services log important operations for debugging
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript types for all inputs and outputs

## Testing Approach
Each service has a corresponding test file with comprehensive coverage:
- Unit tests focus on individual service methods
- Mock dependencies where needed (e.g., ModelResolver mocks PresetManager)
- Edge cases and error conditions thoroughly tested
- Tests serve as documentation for service behavior

## Internal Dependencies
- Services have minimal dependencies on each other:
  - ModelResolver depends on PresetManager
  - All services depend on types and/or config
- No circular dependencies
- Clear dependency flow from orchestrator (LLMService) to services

## External Dependencies
None - all services are pure TypeScript with no external library dependencies

## Integration Points
These services are integrated by LLMService in a specific order:
1. **ModelResolver**: Resolves what model to use
2. **RequestValidator**: Validates the request structure
3. **SettingsManager**: Merges and filters settings  
4. **AdapterRegistry**: Retrieves the appropriate adapter
5. **PresetManager**: Provides preset information when needed

## Usage Examples
```typescript
// PresetManager usage
const presetManager = new PresetManager(customPresets, 'extend');
const preset = presetManager.resolvePreset('my-preset-id');

// AdapterRegistry usage  
const registry = new AdapterRegistry();
const adapter = registry.getAdapter('openai'); // Returns real or mock adapter

// RequestValidator usage
const validator = new RequestValidator();
const error = validator.validateRequestStructure(request);
if (error) return error;

// SettingsManager usage
const manager = new SettingsManager();
const settings = manager.mergeSettingsForModel('gpt-4', 'openai', userSettings);

// ModelResolver usage
const resolver = new ModelResolver(presetManager);
const result = resolver.resolve({ presetId: 'my-preset' });
if (result.error) return result.error;
```
