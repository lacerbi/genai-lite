# Directory: src/llm/services/

Purpose: Contains LLM-specific service classes extracted from LLMService.ts, each handling a specific responsibility in the LLM request processing pipeline.

## Files:

- `RequestValidator.ts`: Validates LLM request structure including messages format, role validation, settings validation, and reasoning capability checks.
- `RequestValidator.test.ts`: Tests the RequestValidator's message validation, settings validation, and reasoning settings validation logic.
- `SettingsManager.ts`: Merges user settings with model/provider defaults including thinking extraction settings, filters out unsupported parameters based on provider/model capabilities, and validates settings extracted from template metadata.
- `SettingsManager.test.ts`: Tests the SettingsManager's settings merging logic and parameter filtering functionality.
- `ModelResolver.ts`: Resolves model information from either preset IDs or direct provider/model IDs, validating provider support and creating fallback ModelInfo for unknown models with flexible validation based on provider configuration.
- `ModelResolver.test.ts`: Tests the ModelResolver's preset resolution, direct ID resolution, fallback model creation, and flexible validation behavior.

## Note:
PresetManager and AdapterRegistry have been moved to `src/shared/services/` as generic implementations used by both LLM and Image services.
