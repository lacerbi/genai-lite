# Directory: src/prompting/

Purpose: Contains sophisticated utilities for prompt engineering, including template rendering, content preparation, and response parsing for LLM interactions.

## Files:

- `index.ts`: Central export point for all prompting utilities, providing a clean API for template rendering, content preparation, and response parsing.
- `template.ts`: Implements a sophisticated micro-templating engine with variable substitution, conditional ternary logic, and intelligent newline handling.
- `template.test.ts`: Comprehensive test suite for the template engine, validating variable substitution, ternary expressions, nested templates, and newline trimming behavior.
- `content.ts`: Provides content preparation utilities including token counting using OpenAI's tiktoken, smart content previews, and random variable extraction for few-shot learning.
- `content.test.ts`: Tests content preparation utilities including token counting accuracy across models, smart preview truncation logic, and random variable extraction.
- `parser.ts`: Provides utilities for parsing structured content from LLM responses using XML-style tags, role tags for message creation, extracting thinking blocks from responses, and parsing template metadata from <META> blocks.
- `parser.test.ts`: Tests structured content parsing functionality, including tag extraction, handling of missing tags, and multiline content parsing.
