- `jest.config.js` - Jest testing framework configuration
- `.npmignore` - Controls which files are published to npm
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project documentation for AI-assisted development

### tsconfig.json
## Purpose
This TypeScript configuration file sets up the compilation settings for the genai-lite library, defining how TypeScript code should be transpiled to JavaScript for distribution.

## Key Settings
- `target: "ES2020"` - Compiles to ES2020 JavaScript syntax for modern runtime support
- `module: "commonjs"` - Outputs CommonJS modules for Node.js compatibility
- `declaration: true` - Generates `.d.ts` type declaration files for TypeScript consumers
- `outDir: "./dist"` - Outputs compiled files to the `dist` directory
- `strict: true` - Enables all strict type-checking options for maximum type safety
- `esModuleInterop: true` - Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES modules

## Dependencies
- TypeScript compiler (tsc)
- Source files in the `src` directory
- Excludes `node_modules` and `dist` directories from compilation

## Scripts
- Used by `npm run build` command to compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- Processes all `.ts` files (including `.test.ts`) in the `src` directory
- Outputs compiled JavaScript and declaration files to `dist/`

## Impact on System
- Enforces strict type safety throughout the codebase
- Ensures consistent module format (CommonJS) for Node.js environments
- Generates type definitions allowing TypeScript consumers to benefit from type checking
- Maintains case-sensitive file naming consistency across different operating systems

## Related Configs
- `package.json` - Contains the build script that uses this configuration
- `.gitignore` - Excludes the `dist` output directory from version control
- Source files must comply with strict TypeScript rules defined here

### jest.config.js
## Purpose
This Jest configuration file sets up the testing environment for a TypeScript-based Node.js project, enabling proper test execution with TypeScript support through ts-jest.

## Key Settings
- `preset: 'ts-jest'` - Uses ts-jest preset for TypeScript compilation during testing
- `testEnvironment: 'node'` - Runs tests in a Node.js environment (not browser/jsdom)
- `testMatch` - Locates test files with patterns: .spec.js/.ts/.jsx/.tsx and .test.js/.ts/.jsx/.tsx
- `testPathIgnorePatterns` - Excludes /node_modules/ and /dist/ directories from test discovery

## Dependencies
- ts-jest - Required for TypeScript compilation during testing
- @types/jest (implied) - TypeScript type definitions for Jest
- jest - The core testing framework

## Scripts
This configuration is used when running npm test commands:
- `npm test` - Runs all tests with this configuration
- `npm run test:watch` - Uses this config for watch mode testing

## Impact on System
- Enables TypeScript test files to be compiled and executed without prior build steps
- Ensures tests run in appropriate Node.js context for backend/library code
- Prevents testing of compiled output (/dist/) and external dependencies (/node_modules/)

## Related Configs
- tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration that ts-jest references for compilation
- package.json - Contains test scripts that utilize this configuration
- .gitignore - Typically excludes the same /dist/ directory

### Other Configuration Files
- **package-lock.json**: Locks exact dependency versions for reproducible CI builds
- **.gitignore**: Excludes build outputs (dist/), logs, OS files, environment variables, and temporary directories from version control

### SESSION_2025-01-12_llama-cpp-integration.md
## Overview
Development session report documenting the implementation of llama.cpp integration and flexible model validation system.

## Key Topics
- llama.cpp server integration with hybrid architecture approach
- LlamaCppServerClient for tokenization, embeddings, and server management
- LlamaCppClientAdapter for OpenAI-compatible chat completions
- Flexible model validation with provider-level allowUnknownModels flag
- createFallbackModelInfo helper for unknown models
- Comprehensive testing (51 new tests, 421 total passing)

## Architecture Decisions
- Hybrid approach: separate adapter for chat vs. server client for utilities
- Silent fallback for flexible providers (llamacpp, mock)
- Warning but allow for strict providers (openai, anthropic, etc.)

## Files Changed
- New: LlamaCppServerClient, LlamaCppClientAdapter + tests
- Modified: config.ts, types.ts, ModelResolver.ts, index.ts
- Updated: README.md with ~250 lines of documentation

## See Also
- src/llm/clients/ for implementation details
- src/llm/services/ModelResolver.ts for validation logic
- README.md llama.cpp section for usage examples

## Architecture
